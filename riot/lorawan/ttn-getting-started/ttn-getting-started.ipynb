    "## Getting started with LoRaWAN on IoT-LAB using RIOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to discover the basics of LoRaWAN communication using RIOT on IoT-LAB and TheThingsNetwork (TTN) as LoRaWAN network provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recommend that you follow the [LoRa boards](../lora-boards/lora-boards.ipynb) notebook if not done already.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is divided in several steps:\n",
    "1. The first step requires you to configure a LoRaWAN application with one device on the TTN backend\n",
    "2. Then you will submit an experiment with one ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 node (known as st-lrwan1) on the Saclay site\n",
    "3. Once the experiment is running, you will build and flash a RIOT application that provides a shell to control the LoRaWAN stack. On the board, you will configure the identifiers and keys required for Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA).\n",
    "4. In the last step of this tutorial, you will exchange messages between the board and TTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRaWAN overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A LoRaWAN network includes a set of subsystems and protocols allowing _end-devices_ to communicate on long distances while consuming little energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate by radio, LoRaWAN devices and gateways use the LoRa radio technology. This technology is based on a Chirp Spreading Spectrum frequency modulation within public radio frequency bands (ISM). The access to the physical layer is regulated and depends on the region of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, LoRaWAN defines the notion of \"datarate\". A datarate index is the combination of a spreading factor (SF) and a bandwidth (BW), as shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-datarate-table.png\" width=\"650\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>LoRaWAN Datarate table for EU868 band</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A datarate of 0 uses a spreading factor of 12 and a bandwidth of 125kHz, in this case the transmission is the slowest (250 bit/s). A datarate of 6 uses a spreading factor of 7 and a bandwidth of 250kHz, the transmission is the fastest in this case (11kbit/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on LoRaWAN [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN) and [here](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/eccc1a_20fe760334f84a9788c5b11820281bd0.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "On IoT-LAB, the EU868 ISM band is used by the boards, because they are all located in Europe and the boards can only transmit on this band.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-classes.jpg\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN stack</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRaWAN specifications define 3 classes of end-devices: A, B, C. Each of which has specific access to the physical layer. For more details, please refer to the LoRa specifications provided by the LoRa Alliance [here](https://www.lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a global overview of a LoRaWAN network:\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN infrastructure</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "End devices use LoRa modulation to communicate with the gateways, which themselves use the regular Internet protocols to communicate with the LoRaWAN server, owned by a provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TTN overview\n",
    "\n",
    "TheThingsNetwork is a LoRaWAN network provider which philosophy is oriented towards open access to IoT networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the network is built by users: anyone can install a gateway connected to the TTN backend and thus increase the global coverage of the network\n",
    "- access to the TTN network is free of charge, without restriction\n",
    "- the TTN ecosystem is very dynamic, especially in Europe (about 3000 gateways already deployed and more than 17,000 applications)\n",
    "\n",
    "A TTN gateway is installed in the IoT-LAB Saclay site and connected to the TTN backend server. Thus, this allows LoRa devices deployed in the Saclay site to communicate with the TTN backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure a TTN application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the LoRa devices in IoT-LAB, you have to create an account and register an application with a device configured on TTN.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you don’t already have a TTN account, create one from [here](https://account.thethingsnetwork.org/register)\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>TTN signup interface</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "After submitting the account creation form, check your emails and then activate the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add an application to your TTN account by following [the official documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/add.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each end-device of a LoRaWAN network is part of a LoRaWAN application. You have to configure a first application to allow you to communicate with your device over LoRa.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Register a device in your TTN application by following [this documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/registration.html).\n",
    "   Keep the default Other-The-Air Activation (OTAA) procedure.The OTAA activation requires 3 parameters:\n",
    "   - **Device EUI**: the device unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string)\n",
    "   - **Application EUI**: the application unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string)\n",
    "   - **Application Key**: the application key is a 16 bytes array (32 hex char string)\n",
    "\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In the following instructions of this tutorial, we consider that your application name is **_iotlab-lorawan_** and your node id is **_iotlab-node_**. \n",
