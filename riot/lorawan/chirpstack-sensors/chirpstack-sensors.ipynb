    "## Autonomously send real sensor values to ChirpStack\n",

    "**Prerequisites:** You must have followed the [getting started with ChirpStack notebook](../chirpstack-getting-started/chirpstack-getting-started.ipynb) before starting this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We also consider that the application id is **iotlab-lorawan** and the device id is **iotlab-node** but you'll have to use the ids corresponding to your application and device configured in ChirpStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will write an autonomous LoRaWAN application with the following specifications:\n",
    "- The application automatically connects to ChirpStack at startup using the OTAA activation and a datarate index of 5\n",
    "- In case of an activation issue, an error message is printed to the console and the application returns\n",
    "- A message is printed to the console to confirm the success of the activation\n",
    "- A message is sent periodically (check the duty cycle!) to the ChirpStack LoRaWAN server. This message will first contain a basic string and in a second phase, it will contain the values measured on the temperature and humidity sensors.\n",
    "- A message is printed to the console each time the message is sent with success.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a starting RIOT application with a [Makefile](Makefile) and a [main.c](./main.c). The [Makefile](Makefile) is already configured but you will have to edit the [main.c](./main.c) by following the instructions of this Notebook.\n",

    "Let's add the final step: read some sensor values from the [X-Nucleo extension shield](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's now edit the [Makefile](Makefile) and [main.c](main.c) to read this sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To be able to use the _hts221_ sensor with RIOT, you must first load the corresponding RIOT module in the application's [Makefile](Makefile). Add the following line to the Makefile (under the addition of the `ztimer_msec` module):\n",
