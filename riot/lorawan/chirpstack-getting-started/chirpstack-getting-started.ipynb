    "## Getting started with LoRaWAN on IoT-LAB using RIOT\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to discover the basics of LoRaWAN communication using RIOT on IoT-LAB and the ChirpStack LoRaWAN Network Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We recommend that you follow the [LoRa boards](../lora-boards/lora-boards.ipynb) notebook if not done already.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is divided in several steps:\n",
    "1. The first step requires you to configure a LoRaWAN application with one device on the Chirpstack backend\n",
    "2. Then you will submit an experiment with one ST B-L072Z-LRWAN1 node (known as st-lrwan1) on the Saclay site\n",
    "3. Once the experiment is running, you will build and flash a RIOT application that provides a shell to control the LoRaWAN stack. On the board, you will configure the identifiers and keys required for Over-The-Air Activation (OTAA).\n",
    "4. In the last step of this tutorial, you will exchange messages between the board and the Chirpstack Network server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRaWAN overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A LoRaWAN network includes a set of subsystems and protocols allowing _end-devices_ to communicate on long distances while consuming little energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate by radio, LoRaWAN devices and gateways use the LoRa radio technology. This technology is based on a Chirp Spreading Spectrum frequency modulation within public radio frequency bands (ISM). The access to the physical layer is regulated and depends on the region of use.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, LoRaWAN defines the notion of \"datarate\". A datarate index is the combination of a spreading factor (SF) and a bandwidth (BW), as shown in the table below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-datarate-table.png\" width=\"650\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>LoRaWAN Datarate table for EU868 band</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "A datarate of 0 uses a spreading factor of 12 and a bandwidth of 125kHz, in this case the transmission is the slowest (250 bit/s). A datarate of 6 uses a spreading factor of 7 and a bandwidth of 250kHz, the transmission is the fastest in this case (11kbit/s).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on LoRaWAN [here](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN) and [here](https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/eccc1a_20fe760334f84a9788c5b11820281bd0.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "On IoT-LAB, the EU868 ISM band is used by the boards, because they are all located in Europe and the boards can only transmit on this band.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lorawan-classes.jpg\" width=\"640\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN stack</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "The LoRaWAN specifications define 3 classes of end-devices: A, B, C. Each of which has specific access to the physical layer. For more details, please refer to the LoRa specifications provided by the LoRa Alliance [here](https://www.lora-alliance.org/lorawan-for-developers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a global overview of a LoRaWAN network:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>The LoRaWAN infrastructure</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "End devices use LoRa modulation to communicate with the gateways, which themselves use the regular Internet protocols to communicate with the LoRaWAN server, owned by a provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ChirpStack overview\n",
    "\n",
    "ChirpStack is an open-source LoRaWAN network which can be used to setup private or public LoRaWAN networks\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/chirpstack-functional-architecture.png\" width=\"800\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>ChirpStack functional architecture</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "- ChirpStack provides a web-interface for the management of gateways, devices and tenants oriented towards open access to IoT networks\n",
    "- ChirpStack server is free of charge, without restriction\n",
    "- Interaction with other external applications for handling device data (cloud providers, databases)\n",
    "\n",
    "A ChirpStack lite gateway is installed in the IoT-LAB Saclay site and connected to the ChirpStack server. Thus, this allows LoRa devices deployed in the Saclay site to communicate with the ChirpStack backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure a ChirpStack application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using the LoRa devices in IoT-LAB, you have to create an account and register an application with a device configured on ChirpStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can access the ChirpStack application with the same IoT-LAB credentials [here](https://services.iot-lab.info/#/login)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",

    "    <figcaption><em>ChirpStack IoT-LAB signup interface</em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add an application to your ChirpStack account by following [the official documentation](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/adding-applications/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each end-device of a LoRaWAN network is part of a LoRaWAN application. You have to configure a first application to allow you to communicate with your device over LoRa.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Register a device in your Chirpstack application by following [this documentation](https://127.0.0.1).\n",
    "   In the application console use the **Add end device button** and register it **manually**. Keep the default Other-The-Air Activation (OTAA) procedure.The OTAA activation requires these parameters:\n",
    "   - **LoRaWAN version**: choose **MAC V1.0.3**\n",
    "   - **Frequency plan**: Choose Europe 863-870 MHz (SF9 for RX2 - recommended)\n",
    "   - **Device EUI**: the device unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string). Generate a random one using the web interface.\n",
    "   - **Application EUI**: the application unique identifier is a 8 bytes array (16 hex char string). Fill it with zeros.\n",
    "   - **Application Key**: the application key is a 16 bytes array (32 hex char string). Generate a random one using the web interface."
