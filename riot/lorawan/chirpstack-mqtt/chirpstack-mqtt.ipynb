    "## Use MQTT with ChirpStack\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** You must have followed at least the [getting started ChirpStack notebook](../chirpstack-getting-started/chirpstack-getting-started.ipynb) before starting this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "> We also consider that the application id is **iotlab-lorawan** and the device id is **iotlab-node** but you'll have to use the ids corresponding to your application and device configured in ChirpStack.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will continue the work done in the [getting started ChirpStack notebook](../chirpstack-getting-started/chirpstack-getting-started.ipynb) and use the MQTT protocol to be able to receive locally the sensor values measured by the LoRa end-device. You will also adapt the RIOT application to be able to receive messages sent via MQTT.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, you will:\n",
    "1. Configure the MQTT access to the ChirpStack LoRaWAN Server\n",
    "2. Start an experiment on IoT-LAB with a LoRa device sending its sensor measures to ChirpStack\n",
    "3. Subscribe to the MQTT topic to receive in Jupyterlab the messages sent by the device\n",
    "4. Extend the provided RIOT application (see the [Makefile](Makefile) and [main.c](main.c) files) to be able to receive messages sent from the LoRaWAN backend\n",
    "5. Publish messages from Jupyterlab and verify they are received on the device\n",
    "\n",
    "### A brief overview of MQTT\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT is a publish/subscribe messaging protocol designed for small sensors and mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MQTT protocol works with a central broker that handles topics to which clients can subscribe or publish to, the principle is illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"text-align:center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"images/pub-sub-model.png\" width=\"500\" align=\"center\"/><br/><br/>\n",
    "    <figcaption><em>Publish/subscribe model of MQTT<br/>Source: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327661439_The_Addition_of_Geolocation_to_Sensor_Networks\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327661439_The_Addition_of_Geolocation_to_Sensor_Networks</a></em></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say client `A` subscribes to the topic `/example/topic`, each message published by client `B` on the same topic will be received by `A`. Several clients can subscribe to the same topic and several clients can publish on the same topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MQTT is very easy to put in place because it only requires one server, the MQTT broker which will handle the subcriptions and publications of all its clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChirpStack LoRaWAN server provides an MQTT API in order to exchange messages with end-devices. Data access with via MQTT on ChirpStack is documented [here](https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/chirpstack/integrations/mqtt.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChirpStack API defines MQTT topics to interact with the end-devices (replace `iotlab-node` with your device id and `iotlab-lorawan` with your application id:\n",
    "- subscribe to the topic **+/devices/iotlab-node/up** to receive messages sent by the end-device\n",
    "- publish on the topic **iotlab-lorawan/devices/iotlab-node/down** to send a message to the end-device"
