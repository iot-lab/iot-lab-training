    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To read the lsm303dlhc sensor in a loop and to start/stop this continous read from a shell command, we will use 2 things:\n",
    "- the continuous read will be done in a separate thread `lsm303dlhc_thread`,\n",
    "- the start/stop feature will use one of the synchronization mechanisms available in RIOT: a mutex. The idea is make the lsm303dlhc thread try to aquire the mutex before reading the values. If the mutex is already aquired by the main thread, the lsm303dlhc thread will be blocked, trying to aquire it. So the start subcommand of the `lsm` shell will just release the mutex to let the lsm303dlhc thread read the values. After each read, the lsm303dlhc thread will release the mutex. The stop subcommand of the `lsm` shell will just aquire the mutex again to clock the lsm303dlhc thread.\n",
    "To read the lsm303dlhc sensor, use the lsm303dlhc module driver. In this part of the exercise, the driver is read from a separate background thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the application [Makefile](Makefile), add the lsm303dlhc module to the build:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Makefile\n",
    "USEMODULE += lsm303dlhc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the [main.c](main.c), add the necessary includes for this driver:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"lsm303dlhc.h\"\n",
    "#include \"lsm303dlhc_params.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Declare the device descriptor variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static lsm303dlhc_t lsm303dlhc;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Declate the mutex used to lock/unlock the lsm303dlhc thread. The mutex is initialized locked in order to block the lsm303dlhc thread at startup.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static mutex_t lsm_lock = MUTEX_INIT_LOCKED;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the main function, initialize the driver:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    lsm303dlhc_init(&lsm303dlhc, &lsm303dlhc_params[0]);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In the lsm303dlhc thread function, acquire the mutex. This call blocks the thread until the mutew is released by another thread:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "        mutex_lock(&lsm_lock);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. In the lsm303dlhc thread function, after the mutex is aquired, the accelerometer/magnetometer values can be read:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "        lsm303dlhc_3d_data_t mag_value;\n",
    "        lsm303dlhc_3d_data_t acc_value;\n",
    "        lsm303dlhc_read_acc(&lsm303dlhc, &acc_value);\n",
    "        printf(\"Accelerometer x: %i y: %i z: %i\\n\",\n",
    "               acc_value.x_axis, acc_value.y_axis, acc_value.z_axis);\n",
    "        lsm303dlhc_read_mag(&lsm303dlhc, &mag_value);\n",
    "        printf(\"Magnetometer x: %i y: %i z: %i\\n\",\n",
    "               mag_value.x_axis, mag_value.y_axis, mag_value.z_axis);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Once the values are read, the mutex must be released:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "        mutex_unlock(&lsm_lock);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Finally we can implement the `start`/`stop` subcommands of the `lsm` shell command `lsm303dlhc_handler` handler:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    if (!strcmp(argv[1], \"start\")) {\n",
    "        mutex_unlock(&lsm_lock);\n",

    "        return -1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",
    "   The `stop` subcommand calls the `mutex_trylock` instead of `mutex_lock` to avoid having the shell blocked when `lsm stop` is called several times in row.\n",
