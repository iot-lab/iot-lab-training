    "## UART\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we propose to use the [UART API of RIOT](http://doc.riot-os.org/group__drivers__periph__uart.html) in conjunction with the main thread to print all characters received on stdio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The application that you will write in this notebook will initialize the STDIO UART with a custom callback function. This callback function is triggered on each UART interrupt, e.g. for each character received, and sends the character via IPC to the main thread. On each IPC message, the main thread prints the content of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implement the application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### I. Adapt the Makefile\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the [Makefile](Makefile)\n",
    "2. Add the dependency to the `periph_uart` feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```make\n",
    "FEATURES_REQUIRED += periph_uart\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### II. Adapt main.c\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the [main.c](main.c) file in a new tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the missing includes for UART peripheral:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"periph/uart.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Declare the message queue. A message queue is needed because IPC messages will be sent from interrupt context.\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#define MSG_QUEUE_SIZE    (8)\n",
    "static msg_t msg_queue[MSG_QUEUE_SIZE];\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Implement the uart callback function: on each character received, this function will send it to the main thread. Note the context arg that contains the pid of the thread.\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static void uart_cb(void *arg, uint8_t data)\n",
    "{\n",
    "       kernel_pid_t *main_pid = (kernel_pid_t *)arg;\n",
    "       msg_t msg;\n",
    "       msg.content.value = data;\n",
    "\n",
    "       msg_send(&msg, *main_pid);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Initialize the STDIO UART: in addition to the callback function implemented above, the main thread pid is given as context parameter.\n",
    "```c\n",
    "       kernel_pid_t main_pid = thread_getpid();\n",
    "       uart_init(STDIO_UART_DEV, STDIO_UART_BAUDRATE, uart_cb, &main_pid);\n",
    "```\n",
    "By default, the `STDIO_UART_DEV` and `STDIO_UART_BAUDRATE` constants correspond to respectively `UART_DEV(0)` and `115200` but can be adjusted a board level if special configuration is needed depending on the board setup.\n",
    "5. Add the reception loop at the end of the main function: it simply is an endless loop that waits for incoming the IPC messages sent from the UART callback function. Each character received is writen to stdout. Also note the message queue initialization: it's important because messages are sent from interupt context and this is not blocking.\n",
    "```c\n",
    "       msg_init_queue(msg_queue, MSG_QUEUE_SIZE);\n",
    "       while (1) {\n",
    "           msg_t msg;\n",
    "           msg_receive(&msg);\n",
    "           printf(\"received: %c\\n\", (char)msg.content.value);\n",
    "       }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
