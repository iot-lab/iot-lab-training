    "In this exercise, you will use timers to add delays between messages displayed in the terminal.\n",
    "The messages will be continuously printed from the main thread and from a second thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RIOT, the `ztimer` module allows for multiplexing several timer contexts on top of a single hardware timer. With the `ztimer` module, it is then possible to manage several virtual timers from a single timer. This single can have 3 levels of precision: seconds (module `ztimer_sec`), millieconds (module `ztimer_msec`) and microseconds (module `ztimer_usec`).\n",

    "```make\n",
    "USEMODULE += ztimer_msec\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the [main.c](main.c) file, include the `ztimer.h` necessary header, below the `thread.h` include:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"ztimer.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the main function, just before `return 0`, add an endless loop that prints a message every 500ms, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    int counter = 0;\n",
    "    while (1) {\n",
    "        counter++;\n",
    "        printf(\"Message %d from main thread\\n\", counter);\n",
    "        \n",
    "        /* add 500ms delay */\n",
    "        ztimer_sleep(ZTIMER_MSEC, 500);\n",
    "    }\n",
