If the mutex is already aquired by the main thread, the lsm303dlhc thread will be blocked, trying to aquire it. So the start subcommand of the `lsm` shell will just release the mutex to let the lsm303dlhc thread read the values. After each read, the lsm303dlhc thread will release the mutex. The stop subcommand of the `lsm` shell will just aquire the mutex again to clock the lsm303dlhc thread.\n",
