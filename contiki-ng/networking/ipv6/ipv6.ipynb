    "## Discover IPv6 and 6LoWPAN\n",
    "\n",
    "In this excercice you will learn how you should communicate with IPV6 and wireless low power devices. The 6LoWPAN protocol has been developed to define the IPv6 adaptation and the way the IP datagrams will be transported over the IEEE802.15.4 radio links. You will deploy a private IPv6 network and test the connectivity between nodes. Moreover you will setup a public IPv6 network with a border router and verify that you can communicate with public servers. Finally with the monitoring feature you will configure a radio sniffer and analyse the traffic. With wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, you will inspect the packets from the different protocols layers with headers and payloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IPv6 overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into the explanations of network configuration on the nodes, it is essential to have some notions about IPv6. Unlike an IPv4 address which is coded on 32 bits (ie 4 bytes) and uses a decimal notation (for example: 192.168.6.19), an IPv6 address is represented by a series of 128 bits (16 bytes), and is represented with a hexadecimal notation. For example, a public IPv6 address (so-called \"global\" unicast address, that is to say routable) on IoT-LAB Grenoble site can have the full representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "`2001:0660:5307:30ff:0000:0000:0000:0001` can be shortened to `2001:660:5307:30ff::1` (a series of 0 contiguous is replaced only once by ::)\n",
    "\n",
    "This 128-bit series is often divided into 2 parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the least significant 64 bits correspond to the address of the host, `::1` in the previous example. Generally, they are constructed from the MAC address of the host to guarantee the uniqueness of an IPv6 address in a subnet (since the physical address isrmally);\n",
    "\n",
    "* the most significant 64 bits correspond to the network address, `2001:660:5307:30ff::/64` in the previous example. They contain in particular the \"prefix\" used for routing IPv6 packets and use, as in IPv4, the CIDR notation: <prefix> / <bit length>. This 64-bit block is divided into a first part containing up to 48 bits and designating the \"site prefix\",  (`2001:660:5307`) the rest of the bits identifying the subnet (`30ff`). A prefix always contains 64 bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some prefixes are reserved for very specific uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fe80::/10` is used for unicast addresses called \"link-local\". This type of address only allows 2 network nodes to communicate if they share a direct physical link. This was the case with two nodes with wireless interface (802.15.4),\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fd00::/8` is intended for \"Unique Local Address\" addresses. These addresses correspond to private addresses in IPv4 and are not routable.\n"
