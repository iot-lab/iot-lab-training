    "The consumption of your node is measured through an INA226 hardware component . The INA226 has programmable conversion times for two measurements, the shunt voltage and the power supply bus voltage. The conversion times (CT) for these measurements can be selected from as fast as 140μs to as long as 8.244ms. The conversion time settings, along with the programmable averaging mode (AV), allow the INA226 to be configured to optimize the available timing requirements in a given application. The periodic measure (PM) is then given by the formula:\n",
